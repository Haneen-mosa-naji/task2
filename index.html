    The city has a long history. The Ibrahimi mosque located in the center of the Old City was
     built over the grave of Abraham, the father of the three monotheistic faiths: Islam,
      Christianity, and Judaism. The full name of the city is Khalil al-Rahman.
       The word “khalil” means friend, and “al-rahman” is one of the names of God in Islam. 
       Abraham was a friend of God. Therefore he was known as Khalil al-Rahman,
        and the city where he is buried was  named  this name (too).  
        The English name most commonly used internationally today for the city,
         "Hebron", is taken from the Biblical (and the modern) Hebrew name,
          Hevron (you can see the Hebrew to the right, in the Arabic-language section).
           The root of this word, haver (Hebrew found to the right)), means friend.
            People have lived in this place for thousands of years, since the days of Abraham</p>
